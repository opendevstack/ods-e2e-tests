# Example Geb and Gradle Project


## Description

This is an example of incorporating Geb into a Gradle build.

The build is setup to work with Chrome, Chrome headless and html. Have a look at the `build.gradle` and the `src/test/resources/GebConfig.groovy` files.

It contains too the Firefox driver that it is not fully tested.

## Usage

You need to set several environment variables in order to make this work, as it is intended to be used in a container / pod lately.

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| E2E_USER | Short name of the user |
| E2E_USER_EMAIL | email of the user (for Jira tools) |
| E2E_USER_PASSWORD | user password |
| JIRA_URL | Url of Jira instance related with the prov app |
| OPENSHIFT_PROJECT | project identifier for prov app |
| OPENSHIFT_PUBLIC_HOST | host where we can locate the prov app |
| OPENSHIFT_CLUSTER | URL of the Openshift Cluster |

The following commands will launch the tests with the individual browsers:

    ./gradlew chromeTest
    ./gradlew htmlunitTest

To run with all, you can run:

    ./gradlew test

Replace `./gradlew` with `gradlew.bat` in the above examples if you're on Windows.
