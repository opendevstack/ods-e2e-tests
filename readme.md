# Automated test cases for ODS

## Description
Suite of test cases for OpenDevStack and the Release Manager.
The build is setup to work with Chrome, Chrome headless and html. Have a look at the `build.gradle` and the `src/test/resources/GebConfig.groovy` files.

It contains too the Firefox driver that it is not fully tested as currently the provissioning app does not work with Firefox

## Usage
You need to set several environment variables in order to make this work, as it is intended to be used in a container / pod lately.

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| E2E_USER | Short name of the user |
| E2E_USER_EMAIL | email of the user (for Jira tools) |
| E2E_USER_PASSWORD | user password |
| JIRA_URL | Url of Jira instance related with the prov app |
| OPENSHIFT_PROJECT | project identifier for prov app in the preliminary tests |
| OPENSHIFT_PUBLIC_HOST | host where we can locate the prov app |
| OPENSHIFT_CLUSTER | URL of the Openshift Cluster |
| BITBUCKET_URL | Url of Bitbucket instance |
| SIMULATE | Specify (true or false)  if we skip the creation of project, components, etc |

The following commands will launch the tests with the individual browsers:

```shell script
# A test spec
$ ./gradlew chromeTest --tests "org.ods.e2e.ODSSpec"
# A specific test
$ ./gradlew chromeTest --tests "org.ods.e2e.ODSSpec.FT_01_003"
```

Replace `./gradlew` with `gradlew.bat` in the above examples if you're on Windows.

## Tests being implemented
### Open Dev Stack
```ODSSpec.groovy```
- [x] FT_01_001 - Use the Provisioning app to create a project and add a Quickstarter.
- [ ] FT_01_002 - To provide evidences that a new boilerplate software updates can be easily added to ODS, and be available for use.
- [x] FT_01_003 - Orchestrate repositories and create LeVA Docs.
- [ ] FT_01_004 - Demonstrate that ODS infrastructure components are deployed and use the services for monitoring, backup and restoring.
- [x] FT_01_005 - Prevent OpenDevStack to delete projects on Atlassian application.

`JiraReleaseManagerSpec.groovy`
- [x] RT_02_001: Check the correctness of calculation â€“ risk assessment without probability of occurrence
- [x] RT_04_001: Test if a C-CSD document can be created. Start creating an application, use Stories in Jira, amend the Documentation chapter issues and check the issue workflows
- [x] RT_06_001: Create Technical Specification Tasks in Jira, check their workflow.
